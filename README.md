Sort Manager Project
Requirements:
You will be building a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:
- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from.
- Decision is given via the command line (using Scanner).
- The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line.
- The program should then output:
1. The unsorted randomly generated array
2. The sort algorithm to be used
3. The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
4. The time taken

The sort manager as a minimum should include a Bubble sort, Binary Tree sort and one other algorithm of your choice

You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the performance of the algorithms (speed tests)

How to run the Program:

- Navigate to SortManager/scr/main/java/org/org.start.
- Run the SortManagerMain.java file.
- The program should ask you to Please enter your option 1-7, and 0 to exit program.
- Then program should ask to enter the size of the array, value should be greater than 0.
- The program will run the sorting and deliver your report for that session to the screen.
        * Unsorted Array
        * Sorted Array
        * Time Taken to complete the sorting.
        * Result comparison between different sorting method.
